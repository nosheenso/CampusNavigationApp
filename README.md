# CampusNavigationApp
The project aims to create an application called the "University Interior Space Navigator" to address the challenges of navigating large university campuses, especially within complex indoor spaces. While external mapping services like Google Maps are helpful outdoors, they often struggle to provide adequate guidance within multi-floor buildings.
